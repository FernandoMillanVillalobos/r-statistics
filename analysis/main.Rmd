## R-Script & data

The preprocessing and analysis of the data was conducted in the [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). The RMarkdown script used to generate this document and all the resulting data can be downloaded [under this link](http://`r user_name`.github.io/`r project_name`/). Through executing `main.Rmd`, the herein described process can be reproduced and this document can be generated. In the course of this, data from the folder `input` will be processed and results will be written to `output`. The html on-line version of the analysis can be accessed through this [link](https://`r user_name`.github.io/`r project_name`/).

# Inferential Statistics

## Linear regression

To perform further analysis with the parameters of our model, we can pipe the model into the tidy function from the __broom__ package. To apply the same model to each variable (e.g. country) is to use the `split > apply > combine` technique. The combination of `group_by` and `summarise` is a method of `split > apply > combine`. Another method for `slice > apply > combine` is to use `group_by` with `slice_max`, and `ungroup`. `\(.x)` is a shorthand option for an anonymous function in R. It was introduced with R 4.1.0. There is not just one way to run many models with the Tidyverse, but many.

![Ways of run many models with Tidyverse](input/img/run-models-tidyverse.png)

First of all, we can differentiate between the three split types:

- _group_: When we talk about groups, we mean that the data is in the form of a grouped tibble.
- _lists_: By lists we mean the native list data type 
- _nested_data_: By nested data, we mean nested data frames in which columns of a data frame contain lists or data frames.

Some methods combine the `apply > combine` step into one function (`split > map_dfr` and `split -> map2_dfr`). All methods have in common that a data frame comes in and a data frame goes out. What kind of data frame is returned depends on what we do in the apply phase. In our case, we chose to output the test statistics or parameters of our models. Similarly, we could also output the predictions of our models.

`group_map` function takes a grouped tibble as input and outputs a list. Before this function, we could not simply iterate a function over groups in a grouped tibble. Instead, we split data frames into a list and applied __purrr__ functions to the elements of that list (e.g., map). If you like, `group_map` is the __dplyr__ version of __purrrâ€™s__ `map` functions.

Compared to `group_map`, this function also accepts a grouped tibble, but outputs a grouped tibble instead of a list. With `group_modify` you have to make sure that a data frame is returned, otherwise the function will yield an error. The great advantage of this method is that we can other the country and continent as columns. The beauty of keeping the country and continent columns is that we can now compare the fit of our model to the actual life expectancies in these countries. To get this data, we can use the `augment` function from the __broom__ package. For each country, the function returns the fitted values of our dependent variable (in our case life expectancy), the residuals and the actual values of the dependent variable.

The combination of `group_split` and `map_dfr` is just an alternative version of `split` and `map_dfr`. `group_split` was introduced in __dplyr__ for version 0.8.0 in 2019. It is still in an experimental state. The difference with `split` is that `group_split` does not name the elements of the returned list.

The `group_nest` function was also introduced with the __dplyr__ version 0.8.0 and works pretty similar to nest. Compared to `nest`, with `group_nest` you name the columns that should not be nested instead of the columns that should be nested.

```{r}
# plotting the development of life expectancy 
ggplot(
  gapminder,
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country)
) +
  geom_line(alpha = .3)

  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country)
) +
  geom_line(alpha = .3) +
  facet_wrap(vars(continent))
